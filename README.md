### Build Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file in the application folder of the project only to match your machine and database configurations. The `.env` file should include the following environment variables:

   - `DB_USER`: Database username
   - `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password
   - `PORT`: Port number for the application

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the application folder using the command `cd application`. This will give you access to all the code within the application folder.

3. Install the required npm modules by running the command `npm install` or `npm i` in your terminal. This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

### Run Instructions

1. Start the application and connect to the database by running the command `npm start` in your terminal. This will start the server for the application.

2. Open your web browser and enter `localhost:3000` in the address bar. This will take you to the home page of the application, where you can use the application as desired.
